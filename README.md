# Curseforge Parsing

I'm sick of not being able to filter by 2 different criteria when searching mods or modpacks on curseforge.

so this is the first part of my attempt at some sort of workaround 

---
Using selenium I'm going to scrape the curseforge site and pull all the information I can about the modpacks and use that 
my own database. Don't know what happens after this. I'll deal with that once I get there. 


using 
* java
* Selenium
* Selenium Webdriver manager
* SLF4J as my logger.
